==== Installation ====

To install the package:

$ cd <ipf source directory>
$ python2.6 install.py /path/to/installation/directory

The Python executable that you use to run install.py will be the one used to run these scripts. Python 2.6 or
2.7 is required.

==== X.509 Configuration ====

The AMQP publishing step in the pre-defined information publishing workflows authenticates via X.509
certificates. This publishing step expects the host certificate to be in etc/cert.pem in the install
directory, the host key to be in etc/key.pem in the install directory, and a list of CA certificated to be in
etc/ca_certs.pem in the install directory.

==== Testing ====

Scripts to run the pre-defined information publishing workflows (in etc/workflow) are generated in the bin
directory. Run these scripts by hand and look at the logging output in var to see if the script executed
ok. If there are failures, you may need to edit the script to adjust the environment or you may need to edit
the workflow to correct any incompatibilities with your system.

==== Deployment ====

This framework is typically deployed by creating cron jobs that periodically run the workflow scripts that you
wish to use. The scripts with "_updates_" in them are typically daemons that run continuously for tasks such
as watching scheduling log files. For these scripts, the cron jobs check that the daemon for the workflow is
running and start it if it is not. The other scripts simple gather information, publish it, and then exit. The
cron jobs for these scripts run this process periodically.
