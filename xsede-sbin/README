Workflow:
NOTE:  create_cacerts.sh is capable of creating the ca_certs.pem that gets put in patches.  If you run it, run it from inside patches.

Current workflow as of 1.5:
build_ipf-xsede_rpm.sh
package ipf-xsede
upload ipf-xsede


checkout-from-git
gets the source from git

build_ipf-xsede_rpm.sh
creates tarball and rpm and put them in dist/

The rest need a little work still--uploading and the like
./sbin/upload
uploads and signs the tarball
./sbin/rpmupload
uploads, signs, pushes rpm to all the repos, and updates all the repos

following are obsolete:
build_glue2_rpm.sh
build_mtk_rpm.sh
