# Installation and Configuration Instructions  
## Introduction

The *Information Publishing Framework* "IPF" is an tool used to publish dynamic HPC, HTC, Visualization, Storage, or Cloud resource information into XSEDE's Information Services in a [standard format](https://www.ogf.org/documents/GFD.147.pdf). Using IPF resource operators publish information about:
 1. Command line software modules 
 2. Remotely accessible network services
 3. Batch system configuration and queue contents
 4. Batch scheduler job events

XSEDE requires Level 1, 2, and 3 operators to publish this dynamic resource information using IPF. It may also be used by campuses and other resource operators who wish publish dynamic HPC information for use by local services. IPF complements XSEDE's Resource Description Repository (RDR) which is used to maintain static resource information. 

The canonical source code repository for IPF can be found at https://github.com/XSEDE/ipf

This document describes how to install and configure IPF.
## Overview
### What is an IPF workflow?

The *Information Publishing Framework*, henceforth "IPF" is a package implemented in python that gathers information from a resource, formats it, and publishes it to XSEDE's Information Services.  Each type of information published, or format in which it is published, has its own "workflow" that defines the steps that IPF should take to discover, format, and publish the information.
### How is an IPF workflow defined?
Each IPF workflow consists of a series of "steps" that can have inputs, outputs, and dependencies.  IPF will automatically pull in a step's dependencies--they need not all be explicitly listed.  

The steps for each workflow are defined in one or more JSON formatted files.  Workflow JSON files can incorporate other workflow JSON files: for example, the `<resource>_services_periodic.json` workflow contains one step, which is the `<resource>_services.json` workflow.

IPF workflows are typically defined by JSON files under $IPF_ETC/ipf/workflow/, particularly in $IPF_ETC/ipf/workflow/glue2.  

### How is an IPF workflow invoked?
A workflow can be invoked by using the `ipf_workflow` script that is found in $INSTALL_DIR/ipf-VERSION/ipf/bin/.  Syntax is `$INSTALL_DIR/ipf-VERSION/ipf/bin/ipf_workflow <workflow.json>`.

Workflow json files are specified relative to $IPF_ETC, so `ipf_workflow sysinfo.json` and `ipf_workflow glue2/<resource>_services.json` are both valid invokations.

Scripts for init.d are provided by ipf_configure_xsede for each workflow it configures.  The init.d scripts can be found in $IPF_ETC/ipf/init.d.  Each script runs one workflow, on a periodic basis, and are typically copied into the system /etc/init.d directory as part of the installation process.
### Detailed IPF design documentation
The detailed IPF design documentation can be found at https://info.xsede.org/info/IPF-design

### Which workflows should I configure and run?

The following workflows are recommended for the listed scenarios.
These recommendations are under review and may be revised in the future.

Software Module workflow: all Level 1, 2 and 3*SPs that offer *login and batch computing

Network Accessible Services workflow: all Level 1, 2, and 3*SPs that operate *login or GridFTP services

Batch System workflow (compute workflow): all Level 1, 2, and 3*SPs that offer *batch computing

Batch Scheduler Job Event workflow (activity workflow): all Level 1 and 2*SPs that offer *XSEDEallocated batch computing

## Requirements

### Software Modules workflow requirements
- The module files must be readable.

### Network Accessible Services workflow requirements
- The service definition files must be readable, and in a (flat) services directory.  See section:  Configuring Service Files

### Batch System workflow requirements 
- The command line programs of your batch scheduler must be executable.

### Batch Scheduler Job Events workflow requirements
- The batch scheduler log file or directory must be readable on the server where IPF is running and by the user running IPF.
- The batch scheduler must be logging at the right level of detail for the IPF code to be able to parse the events.  See the section: Configuring Torque Logging.

## Preparing for Installation

- Before installing IPF operators should register their resource in RDR.
- Install and run IPF on a single server for each resource.
- If IPF will authenticate to Information Services using a X.509 host key/certificate, the public and private keys must be readable by the user running IPF.
- To install IPF on machines that are part of multiple XSEDE resources please first review [XSEDE's Advanced Integration Options](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/99081/XSEDE_SP_Advanced_Integration_Options.pdf) documentation.
- If you already have an older IPF create a backup of the /etc/ipf working configurations:

$ tar -cf ipf-etc-yyyymmdd.tar /etc/ipf

### Software Dependencies
- Python 3.6 or newer
- The python-amqp package, version between 1.4.0 and 1.4.9
- The python-setuptools package IF installing by RPM.
- (Optional) The xdresourceid tool. If not available a resourceid will need to be configured by hand.

*These dependencies are encoded in the RPM.*

## Installation
There are two recommended ways to install IPF: you can use pip install, or you can install from the XSEDE RPMs on software.xsede.org.


Installing IPF from RPMs will put it in the directories /usr/lib/python-`<VERSION>`/site-packages/ipf, /etc/ipf, /var/ipf).

To install to an alternate location install we recommend using pip.

### Pip installation

To install using pip, you need to have the pip package installed in an appropriate version of Python (3.6+).  We recommend using venv to manage python installations.  More information on venv can be found at https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/

Once you have a python 3.6 environment (whether venv or not), installation is as simple as:

$ pip install ipf

### RPM Installation

Note(s):
 - The RPM will automatically create an "xdinfo" account that will own the install and that will execute the workflows via sudo.

Steps:
1) Configure XSEDE RPM repository trust
For a production version use [Production Repo Trust Instructions](https://software.xsede.org/production/repo/repoconfig.txt)
For a development/testing version use [Development Repo Trust Instructions](https://software.xsede.org/development/repo/repoconfig.txt)

2) Install ipf-xsede

$ yum install ipf-xsede

### tar.gz Installation

Installing from the tar.gz is no longer recommended.  It will still work, but we recommend using venv and pip to install to alternate locations, and/or development versions.

Note(s):
- If you need to install development versions, replace the URL prefixes 'http://software.xsede.org/production' with 'http://software.xsede.org/development' in the instructions below.

1) Create a normal user to run this software
   The recommended username 'xdinfo', but you can use a different one

2) Install the Python amqp package. It MUST be at least version 1.4.0, and must have major version of 1 (2.0 and above will not work).  At this time, 1.4.9 is the recommended version of amqp.
    You can 'yum install python-amqp', 'pip install amqp' (into the default location or into a Python virtualenv) or you can install from a "wheel" download from pypi. You may need to do this as root, depending on the install directory (e.g. /opt/). These files need to be readable by the user you created in step 1).
   a) Look at the files from https://pypi.org/project/amqp/1.4.9/#files/
	specifically, download:
https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ed/09/314d2788aba0aa91f2578071a6484f87a615172a98c309c2aad3433da90b/amqp-1.4.9-py2.py3-none-any.whl

   b) pip install -install-option="-prefix=$PREFIX_PATH" amqp-1.4.9-py2.py3-none-any.whl
     (where $PREFIX_PATH is your AMQP_PATH, i.e. the place you want to install the amqp lib)


3) Install the XSEDE version of the Information Publishing Framework (ipf-xsede):
   a) Download the .tgz file from http://software.xsede.org/production/ipf/ipf-xsede/latest/
   b) Untar this file into your install directory. The result will be a directory hierarchy under

    $ INSTALL_DIR/ipf-VERSION.

4) As the user created in step 1), configure the ipf_workflow script in $ INSTALL_DIR/ipf-VERSION/ipf/bin
   a) Set PYTHON to be name of (or the full path to) the python interpreter you wish to use
   b) If you installed Python amqp into a non-default location, set AMQP_PATH to be the path where you installed it and uncomment this line and the following line that sets PYTHONPATH
   d) Run '$INSTALL_DIR/ipf-VERSION/ipf/bin/ipf_workflow sysinfo.json'. The workflow steps should run, but you may see failures related to host and/or site names.

## Updating an ipf-xsede installation

The json files that have been written by previous runs of ipf_configure_xsede would, in some previous versions of IPF get overwritten by subsequent runs of ipf_configure_xsede.  This is no longer the case--previous versions get backed up, not overwritten.  They will _not_ be erased by removing OR updating the package (nor will the service files copied to /etc/init.d be erased). 

To perform the update to the latest RPM distribution of ipf-xsede:

 1. $ sudo yum update ipf-xsede
 2. If there are new workflows you need to configure, follow the configuration steps as outlined in the Configuration section below.

If you are updating an installation that was performed using the tar.gz distribution, it is recommended that you simply install the new version into a new directory.  Since everything (aside from the service files copied to /etc/init.d) is contained within a single directory, the new installation should not interfere with previous installations.  Note that if you do not make any changes to the service files copied to /etc/init.d, they will continue to use the older version.  Update the IPF_ETC_PATH, IPF_VAR_PATH, and PROGRAM (with full path to ipf_workflow program) to the values corresponding to your updated installation to utilize the updated version of ipf-xsede.

## Configuration

If you are upgrading to IPF 1.4 from IPF 1.3, you MUST re-run the ipf_configure_xsede script to re-generate your workflow definition files.  If you do not, you will run into errors where IPF can't infer which step to use.

To make configuration easier, an `ipf_configure_xsede` script is provided in the bin directory (in /usr/bin if you installed RPMs, otherwise in $INSTALL_DIR/ipf-VERSION/ipf/bin). This script will ask you questions and generate workflow definition files and example init files.  If you intend to publish module (or extended attribute module) information, you are advised to set the environment variable MODULEPATH to point to the location of the module files before running ipf_configure_xsede.  If you intend to publish the service workflow, you are advised to set SERVICEPATH to point to the location of the service definition files before running ipf_configure_xsede (more on this below).

* `ipf_configure_xsede` should be run as the user that will run the information gathering workflows

* `ipf_configure_xsede` will attempt to discover the XSEDE name of your resource using the xdresourceid program. If you have the xdresourceid program installed on your server, load it into your command line environment before running ipf_configure_xsede.

* The preferred way to authenticate is via an X.509 host certificate and key. You can place these files wherever you like (the configuration program will ask you for their location), but the default locations are /etc/grid-security/xdinfo-hostcert.pem and /etc/grid-security/xdinfo-hostkey.pem. These files must be readable by the user that runs the information gathering workflows.

* Submit an XSEDE ticket to authenticate your server to the XSEDE RabbitMQ services. If you will authenticate via X.509, include the output of 'openssl x509 -in path/to/cert.pem -nameopt RFC2253 -subject -noout' in your ticket. If you will authenticate via username and password, state that and someone will contact you.

Note: The xdinfo user as created by the ipf-xsede rpm installation has /bin/nologin set as its shell by default. This is because for most purposes, the xdinfo user doesn’t need an interactive shell. However, for some of the initial setup, it is easiest to use the xdinfo user with an interactive shell (so that certain environment variables like MODULEPATH can be discovered.)  Thus, it is recommended that the configuration steps are run after something like the following:

    $ sudo -u xdinfo -s /bin/bash --rcfile /etc/bashrc -i
    $ echo $MODULEPATH
    $ echo $SERVICEPATH

Execute:

    $ ipf_configure_xsede

Follow the instructions and enter the requested information. If you encounter any errors or the script does not cover your situation, please submit an XSEDE ticket.

When the script exits, the etc/ipf/workflow/glue2/ directory will contain a set of files RESOURCE_NAME_*.json that describe the information gathering workflows you have configured and etc/ipf/init.d will contain ipf-RESOURCE_NAME_* files which are the init scripts you have configured.

As root, copy the etc/ipf/init.d/ipf-RESOURCE_NAME-* files into /etc/init.d. Your information gathering workflows can then be enabled, started, and stopped in the usual ways.  You may need to perform a 'chkconfig --add' or equivalent for each service.

## Configuring Scheduler Logging for Activity Workflow
### Torque
It is necessary for Torque to log at the correct level in order for IPF to be able to parse the messages that it uses in determining state.  Furthermore, the logging level of Torque can be confusing, as it has both a log_level and a log_events (which is a bitmask).  The most important setting is that log_events should be set to 255.  This ensures that all types of events are logged.  You can check the setting on your Torque installation by using "qmgr".
### SLURM
The SLURM logs must be in a directory that is local to and accessible to the IPF installation.  `ipf_configure_xsede` allows one to set this location for the workflow.


##Configuring Service Files
The information in the this section is applicable both to those editing
existing service.conf files, and those creating them from scratch.

Each service.conf file needs to have a Name, Version, Endpoint, and
Capability.

The Name field refers to the GLUE2 Primary protocol name supported by the service endpoint, as seen in the table below.

Each service can have multiple capabilities, but each line is a key/value
pair, so to publish multiple capabilities for a service, have a line that
starts "Capability = " for each value.  (see example below).  Note:  in MDS
publishing, separate services were published for striped/non-striped GridFTP
servers, even if the endpoint URL was the same.  In IPF publishing, the
Capability fields describe what the service at the endpoint URL supports.

Valid capability values can be seen in the table below.  Please edit your
service.conf files to include appropriate Capability values.

A key/value pair for SupportStatus in your service.conf file will override the
default, which is the support status of your service as published in RDR.

_________________________________________________________________________
A table of valid Name, version and capability values:

    Name			Version			Capability
    org.globus.gridftp 	{5,6}.y.z 	data.transfer.striped
	        						data.transfer.nonstriped

    SupportStatus = testing


## Best Practices for Software publishing  (Modules Files)

XSEDE has two levels of software information that are published:  the software
catalog at the Portal (which is used for global, static software information),
and the dynamic software information published to Information Services using
the IPF pub/sub publishing framework.

The information published via the IPF pub/sub publishing framework is meant to
be information that is local to the installation--if there is global
information it should be published at the XSEDE Portal.

The XSEDE IPF pub/sub publishing framework attempts to make intelligent
inferences from the system installed modules files when it publishes software
information.  There are some easy ways, however, to add information to your
module files that will enhance/override the information otherwise published.

The Modules workflows for IPF search your MODULEPATH, and infer fields such as
name and version from the directory structure/naming conventions of the module
file layout.  Depending on the exact workflow steps, fields such as
Description may be blank, or inferred from the stdout/stderr text of the
module.  However, the following fields can always be added to a module file to
be published:

    Description:
    URL:
    Category:
    Keywords:
    SupportStatus:
    SupportContact:

Each field is a key: value pair.  The IPF workflows are searching the whole
text of each module file for these fields--they may be placed in a
module-whatis line, or in a comment, and IPF will still read them.

Note: the value for SupportContact takes the form of either a URL that returns the expected json, normally from the xcsr-db API, for example: `https://info.xsede.org/wh1/xcsr-db/v1/supportcontacts/globalid/helpdesk.xsede.org/`
or directly a one-liner json blob of the form:

`[{"GlobalID":"helpdesk.xsede.org","Name":"XSEDE Help Desk","Description":"XSEDE 24/7 support help desk","ShortName":"XSEDE","ContactEmail":"help@xsede.org","ContactURL":"https://www.xsede.org/get-help","ContactPhone":"1-866-907-2383"}]`

All XSEDE registered support contact organizations are found at: `https://info.xsede.org/wh1/xcsr-db/v1/supportcontacts/`.
To register a new support contact e-mail help@xsede.org using the Subject: Please register a new Support Contact Organization in the CSR.

`ipf_configure_xsede` offers the opportunity to define a default SupportContact that is published for every module that does not define its own.  By default, this value is: `https://info.xsede.org/wh1/xcsr-db/v1/supportcontacts/globalid/helpdesk.xsede.org/`

Example:

    #%Module1.0#####################################################################
    ##
    ## modulefiles/xdresourceid/1.0
    ##
    module-whatis "Description: XSEDE Resource Identifier Tool"
    module-whatis "URL: http://software.xsede.org/development/xdresourceid/"
    module-whatis "Category: System tools"
    module-whatis "Keywords: information"
    module-whatis "SupportStatus: testing"
    module-whatis "SupportContact: https://info.xsede.org/wh1/xcsr-db/v1/supportcontacts/globalid/helpdesk.xsede.org/"

However, IPF would read these just as well if they were:

    #%Module1.0#####################################################################
    ##
    ## modulefiles/xdresourceid/1.0
    ##
    #module-whatis "Description: XSEDE Resource Identifier Tool"
    # "URL: http://software.xsede.org/development/xdresourceid/"
    # Random text that is irrelevant "Category: System tools"
    # module-whatis "Keywords: information"
    module-whatis "SupportStatus: testing"
    module-whatis "SupportContact: https://info.xsede.org/wh1/xcsr-db/v1/supportcontacts/globalid/helpdesk.xsede.org/"

To this end, XSEDE recommends that you add these fields to relevant module
files.  The decision on whether to include them as module-whatis lines (and
therefore visible as such to local users) or to include them as comments is
left to the site admins.

## Testing
In IPF 1.3 and higher, lmod/modules workflows are deprecated, and extmodules
should be used for all software publishing.

1) To test the extended attribute modules workflow, execute:

    # service ipf-RESOURCE_NAME-glue2-extmodules start

This init script starts a workflow that periodically gathers (every hour by default) and publishes module information containing extended attributes.

The log file is in /var/ipf/RESOURCE_NAME_modules.log (or $INSTALL_DIR/ipf/var/ipf/RESOURCE_NAME_extmodules.log) and should contain messages resembling:

    2013-05-30 15:27:05,309 - ipf.engine - INFO - starting workflow extmodules
    2013-05-30 15:27:05,475 - ipf.publish.AmqpStep - INFO - step-3 - publishing representation ApplicationsOgfJson of Applications lonestar4.tacc.teragrid.org
    2013-05-30 15:27:05,566 - ipf.publish.FileStep - INFO - step-4 - writing representation ApplicationsOgfJson of Applications lonestar4.tacc.teragrid.org
    2013-05-30 15:27:06,336 - ipf.engine - INFO - workflow succeeded

If any of the steps fail, that will be reported and an error message and stack trace should appear. Typical failures are caused by the environment not having specific variables or commands available.

This workflow describes your modules as a JSON document containing GLUE v2.0 Application Environment and Application Handle objects. This document is published to the XSEDE messaging services in step-3 and is written to a local file in step-4. You can examine this local file in /var/ipf/RESOURCE_NAME_apps.json. If you see any errors in gathering module information, please submit an XSEDE ticket to SD&I.


2) To test the compute workflow, execute:

    # service ipf-RESOURCE_NAME-glue2-compute start

This init script starts a workflow that periodically gathers (every minute by default) and publishes information about your compute resource. This workflow generates two types of documents. The first type describes the current state of your resource. This document doesn't contain sensitive information and XSEDE makes it available without authentication. The second type describes the queue state of your resource, contains sensitive information (user names), and will only be made available to authenticated XSEDE users.

The log file is in /var/ipf/RESOURCE_NAME_compute.log (or $INSTALL_DIR/ipf/var/ipf/RESOURCE_NAME_compute.log) and should contain messages resembling:

    2013-05-30 15:50:43,590 - ipf.engine - INFO - starting workflow sge_compute
    2013-05-30 15:50:45,403 - ipf.publish.AmqpStep - INFO - step-12 - publishing representation PrivateOgfJson of Private stampede.tacc.teragrid.org

    2013-05-30 15:50:46,110 - ipf.publish.FileStep - INFO - step-13 - writing representation PublicOgfJson of Public stampede.tacc.teragrid.org
    2013-05-30 15:50:46,516 - ipf.engine - INFO - workflow succeeded

Typical failures are caused by the execution environment not having specific commands available. Review the environment setup in the init script.

You can examine /var/ipf/RESOURCE_NAME_compute.json (or $INSTALL_DIR/ipf/var/ipf/RESOURCE_NAME_compute.json) to determine if the description of your resource is accurate. You can also exampine /var/ipf/RESOURCE_NAME_activities.json ( or $INSTALL_DIR/ipf/var/ipf/RESOURCE_NAME_activities.json) to determine if the description of the jobs being managed by your resource is correct.

3) To test the activity workflow, execute:

    # service ipf-RESOURCE_NAME-glue2-activity start

This init script starts a long-running workflow that watches your scheduler log files and publishes information about jobs as they are submitted and change state.

The log file is in /var/ipf/RESOURCE_NAME_activity.log (or $INSTALL_DIR/ipf/var/ipf/RESOURCE_NAME_activity.log) and should contain messages resembling:

    2013-05-30 16:04:26,030 - ipf.engine - INFO - starting workflow pbs_activity
    2013-05-30 16:04:26,038 - glue2.pbs.ComputingActivityUpdateStep - INFO - step-3 - running

    ...

You can look at the activity information published in /var/ipf/RESOURCE_NAME_activity.json (or $INSTALL_DIR/ipf/var/ipf/RESOURCE_NAME_activity.json). This file contains the sequence of activity JSON documents published.

4) To test the Abstract Service (services) workflow, execute:

    # service ipf-RESOURCE_NAME-glue2-services start

This init script starts a workflow that periodically gathers (every hour by default) and publishes service information from the service definition files. 

The log file is in /var/ipf/RESOURCE_NAME_services.log (or $INSTALL_DIR/ipf/var/ipf/RESOURCE_NAME_services.log) and should contain messages resembling:

    2013-05-30 15:27:05,309 - ipf.engine - INFO - starting workflow s
    2013-05-30 15:27:05,475 - ipf.publish.AmqpStep - INFO - step-3 - publishing representation ASOgfJson of AbstractServices lonestar4.tacc.teragrid.org

If any of the steps fail, that will be reported and an error message and stack trace should appear. Typical failures are caused by the environment not having specific variables or commands available.

This workflow describes your modules as a JSON document containing GLUE v2.0 Application Environment and Application Handle objects. This document is published to the XSEDE messaging services in step-3 and is written to a local file in step-4. You can examine this local file in /var/ipf/RESOURCE_NAME_apps.json. If you see any errors in gathering module information, please submit an XSEDE ticket to SD&I.

## Log File Management

The log files described above will grow over time. The logs are only needed for debugging, so they can be deleted whenever you wish. logrotate is a convenient tool for creating archival log files and limiting the amount of files kept. One note is that the ipf workflows keep the log files open while they run, so you should either use the copytruncate option or have a post-rotate statement to restart the corresponding ipf service.
