## What is Community Software?

The software on XSEDE resources can be clasified into three categories based on who installs and maintains it and on who
the target users of that software are:
1. XSEDE Service Provider "SP" installed software made available to **their users** on a resource
2. XSEDE allocated project installed software, most often applications, for **personal project use**
3. XSEDE allocated project installed software made available to **other users** on a resource

XSEDE SPs use the *Information Publishing Framework* (IPF) tool to publishing descriptive information about the first
category of software. All XSEDE SPs, including allocated, unallocated, and campus Level 1, 2, and 3 SPs, may use IPF.
The published descriptive information is aggregated by XSEDE's Information Services and made available thru APIs used
by the User Portal, the Research Software Portal, and Science Gateways to enable users to discover software.

This documentation explains how an XSEDE allocated project that installs and maintains software on XSEDE resources,
as described in the third category above, can also use the IPF tool to publish information about their software and
thus make their software more discoverable by XSEDE users. Science Gateways and producing software for community use
will find this ability most useful.

## How to Publish Community Software

The *Information Publishing Framework* "IPF" is a tool used by resource operators to publish dynamic
HPC, HTC, Visualization, Storage, or Cloud resource information to XSEDE's Information Services in a
[GLUE2 standard format](https://www.ogf.org/documents/GFD.147.pdf).
IPF can publish four types of resource information:
 1. Command line software modules 
 2. Batch system configuration and queue contents
 3. Batch scheduler job events
 4. Remotely accessible network services

XSEDE requires Level 1, 2, and 3 operators to publish this dynamic resource information using IPF.
It is also avaialble to campuses and other resource operators who would like to publish dynamic
information to XSEDE information services for use by local services, portals, or gateways. 
IPF complements XSEDE's Resource Description Repository "RDR" which is used to maintain
static resource information. 

The canonical source code repository for IPF can be found at [https://github.com/XSEDE/ipf](https://github.com/XSEDE/ipf.).

This document describes how to install and configure IPF.

### Pre-requisites
- zzzzzzzzzzzfiles must be readable.

### Registering a Support Organization
- zzzzzzzzzzzzzefinition files must be readable, and in a (flat) services directory.

### Preparing Module Files
- zzzzzzzzzzzzzzne programs of your batch scheduler must be executable.

### Requesting that SPs publish your Module Files
- The batch scheduler log file or directory must be readable on the server where IPF is running and by the user running IPF.
- The batch scheduler must be logging at the right level of detail for the IPF code to be able to parse the events.  See the section: Configuring Torque Logging.

### Verying that your software has been published
