IPF 1.7 Improvements Plan

	*	Scheduler improvements: 
	**	make all aspects of interaction between IPF and schedulers parameterizable so that changes in the schedulers do not require new IPF code
	**	Fix IPF utilization 
	**	Improve configuration, bootstrapping of position files for monitoring slurmctl.log
	*	Modules improvements:
	**	Do not publish modules with a donâ€™t publish flag
	*	Configuration and documentation
	**	Refactor IPF configuration  (clarify entire process, add command line parameters to (re)configure single specific workflows)
	**	Top to bottom revision of IPF documentation for clarity and completeness
	*	Address keeping ca_certs.pem up to date with XSEDE trusted CAs
	*	Move to python-amqp 2.4
	*	Internal Release process improvements
	**	Revise test plan to explicitly rely on the end-to-end tests
